# Bot-Template
A simple discord bot template that I use for all my TypeScript bots. This is adapted from [Codeize's template](https://github.com/Codeize/template). If you're wondering why the code was uploaded so fast, it's because the code was copy pasted from my text editor, because the files were too big to upload.

## Todo
Finish src/bot/events
Finish lib/classes
